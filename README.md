zinit light zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions

```

### Description of the plugins installed above
- <b>zdharma / fast-syntax-highlighting</b>: Adds syntax highlighting when writing commands that makes it easier to recognize commands that were typed incorrectly;

- <b>zsh-users / zsh-autosuggestions</b>: Suggests commands based on the execution history as you type;

- <b>zsh-users / zsh-completions</b>: Adds thousands of completitions for common tools like Yarn, Homebrew, NVM, Node, etc., so you only need to press TAB to complete commands;
